							<p>"I can't breathe." So said Eric Garner multiple times as officers wrestled him to the ground and one — Daniel Pantaleo — placed him in a chokehold. Police approached Garner, who was unarmed, for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes.  </p>
							<p>Garner remained lying on the sidewalk for seven minutes while the officers waited for an ambulance to arrive. The officers and emergency medical technicians did not perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on Garner at the scene; according to a spokesman for the PBA, this was because they believed that Garner was breathing and that it would be improper to perform CPR on someone who was still breathing. He was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>
							<p>A medical examiner ruled Garner's death a homicide, but a jury declined to indict Pantaleo. Garner's family received $5.9 million from the City of New York in a settlement.</p>
