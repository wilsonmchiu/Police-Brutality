							<p>Sterling was selling CDs outside a convenience store when two officers, Howie Lake and Blane Salamoni, approached amid a report of a man with a gun. Officers wrestled the 300-pound Sterling to the ground because he refused an order, they said. Salamoni shot Sterling three times, claiming Sterling reached for a gun in his pocket. As Sterling began to sit up, Salamoni fired three more shots into his back. They later found Sterling, a convicted felon, was illegally carrying a gun. </p>
							<p>No charges will come against either officer, a state attorney general announced in March 2018. </p>
