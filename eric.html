							<p>Robert Bates, a 74-year-old volunteer sheriff's deputy, claimed he confused his .38-caliber handgun for a stun gun and accidentally shot an unarmed Eric Harris after Harris fled a sting involving a gun sale. A single shot is heard on video footage before a voice says, "I'm sorry. I shot him." As Harris writhes in pain and says he cannot breathe, a deputy responds, "(Expletive) your breath."  </p>
							<p>Authorities say Eric Harris was trying to sell an undercover officer a gun when more officers arrived and he fled. Police cameras captured the exchange, chase and deadly shooting by reserve deputy Robert Bates, who says he meant to fire his stun gun. </p>
							<p>Bates received a four-year prison sentence in 2016, according to the Tulsa World, but was released in October 2017.</p>
