							<p>Betty Shelby, a white Tulsa police offer, called the unarmed Crutcher a "bad dude" before fatally shooting him with his hands up as he stood near his vehicle in a street.</p>
							<p>A frame grab from video released by the Tulsa Police Department shows Terrence Crutcher walking with his hands in the air as he is confronted by police on Sept. 16 2016.</p>
							<p> A jury acquitted her of first-degree manslaughter in 2017, and Shelby later resigned from the department.</p>
